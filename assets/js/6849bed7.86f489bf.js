Our system regularly polls for new incoming transactions.\nIf y payment is found we evaluate the "additional information" on the payment slip which\nshould give us the information to which contract or address we shall mint new tokens. If\nthis information is not there or an error case, we fall back to a default. Important is,\nthat the balance of the bank account and the stable-coins stay the same. A default can be\nto wire-transfer funds back to the originator or to mint the stable-coins to a predefined address.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(n.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(n.code,{children:"+-------------+          +-------------------+              +-------------------+                         +---------------+           +---------------+         \n| BankAccount |          | OpenBankingClient |              | EventProcessing   |                         | FiatChain     |           | TargetAccount |         \n+-------------+          +-------------------+              +-------------------+                         +---------------+           +---------------+     \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |          \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |\n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |           Check new Transactions |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |<---------------------------------|                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |           daily statement |                                  |                                           |                           |                        \n       |<--------------------------|                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  | found new incoming Payment:+100 \u20ac         |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |----------------------------------         |                           |                        \n       |                           |                                  |                                 |         |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |<---------------------------------         |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  | mint 100 to TargetAddress                 |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |------------------------------------------\x3e|                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           | assign 100 tokens         |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |--------------------------\x3e|                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |        \n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |\n       |                           |                                  |                                           |                           |                         \n"})})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}}}]);
