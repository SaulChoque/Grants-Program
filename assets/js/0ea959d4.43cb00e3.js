Therefore a sound funding mechanism has been established, The Developer Incentive Program, where all the projects building on Clover can benefit from a share of transaction fees. The Developer Incentive Program (DIP) is a Clover-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in Clover third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the Clover DeFi ecosystem overall. The program is consistent with Clover\u2019s properties of being a decentralized operating system which does not touch the inflation schedule or alter the scarcity of CLV, but effectively increases the security of smart contracts against bugs and software vulnerabilities by enabling external development to be properly funded. Overall the benefits of the plan create the potential for a very exciting future in which Clover can grow and compete, and can reach its goal of becoming the best possible DeFi platform for all.
