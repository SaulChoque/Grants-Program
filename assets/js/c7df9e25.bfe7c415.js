The initial fraud-proof consists of the first differing program counter (PC) in execution trace and the state (i.e., dirty page of the memory and stack) before the differing PC. The challenged claimer can dispute the state and find the first differing state interactively with the challenger. When either the differing PC or state is found, the chain will re-execute partially from the state and PC with consensus (i.e., state and PC before the differing ones) using LLVM bytecode virtual machine. Since the execution would lead to a concrete result that is directly equal to that of either challenger or claimer, the chain can decide which party is gaming.
