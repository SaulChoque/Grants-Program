This milestone will allow the developer to define different subscription tiers, the price of each tier, what functions and/or pallets are allowed in each tier, and the maximum amount of function calls for each tier. Based on what subcription tier the DAO is paying for, only those functions will be allowed to be called by the DAO and its members. Finally, this milestone will also allow each tier to have a maximum amount of members allowed in the DAO."})]})]})]}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"milestone-3--add-recurring-subcription-payment-to-pallet",children:"Milestone 3 \u2014 Add Recurring Subcription Payment to Pallet"}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Estimated duration:"})," 1 month"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"FTE:"}),"  2"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Costs:"})," 10,000 USDC"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.table,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.thead,{children:(0,s.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.th,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:"Number"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.th,{children:"Deliverable"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.th,{children:"Specification"})]})}),(0,s.jsxs)(t.tbody,{children:[(0,s.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:"0a."}),(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{children:"License"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{children:"Apache 2.0"})]}),(0,s.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:"0b."}),(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{children:"Documentation"}),(0,s.jsxs)(t.td,{children:["We will provide both ",(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"inline documentation"})," of the code and a basic ",(0,s.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"tutorial"})," that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works."]})]}),(0,s.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:"0c."}),(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{children:"Testing Guide"}),(0,s.jsx)(t.td,{children:"Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness.
