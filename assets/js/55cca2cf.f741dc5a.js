This wireframe serves as a visual representation of how the user will interact with the project and provides a clear roadmap for the design and development process. By creating a wireframe at the early stages of development, we can identify any potential usability issues and make adjustments before investing significant time and resources into the design and development process. Ultimately, this will lead to a better user experience and a more successful project."]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.h2,{id:"development-roadmap-nut_and_bolt",children:["Development Roadmap ","\ud83d\udd29"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Described in project details."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"overview-1",children:"Overview"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Total Estimated Duration:"})," 4 months"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):"})," 2 FTE"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Total Costs:"})," 20,000 USD"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"milestone-1--ui-and-contract-development",children:"Milestone 1 \u2014 UI and Contract Development"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Estimated duration:"})," 4 months"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"FTE:"})," 2"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.li,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Costs:"})," 20,000 USD"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.table,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.thead,{children:(0,a.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.th,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:"Number"}),(0,a.jsx)(t.th,{children:"Deliverable"}),(0,a.jsx)(t.th,{children:"Specification"})]})}),(0,a.jsxs)(t.tbody,{children:[(0,a.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.td,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"0a."})}),(0,a.jsx)(t.td,{children:"License"}),(0,a.jsx)(t.td,{children:"GPLv3"})]}),(0,a.jsxs)(t.tr,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.td,{style:{textAlign:"right"},children:(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"0b."})}),(0,a.jsx)(t.td,{children:"Documentation"}),(0,a.jsxs)(t.td,{children:["We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can generate its own smart contracts.
