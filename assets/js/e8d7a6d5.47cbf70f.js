The smart contract will take a signed certificate and signature as input verify either an sr25519 or ed25519 signature with a fixed enclave public key stored in the contract. The contract will then parse the ",(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://cbor.io/",children:"CBOR"})," encoded certificate data to extract the verified key-value pairs and optionally store them on chain. We will deploy the smart contract to a Polkadot testnet and provide an example DApp to demonstrate the flow of generating Instagram account verification certificates with Silent Data and verifying them in a smart contract."]})]})]})]}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"future-plans",children:"Future Plans"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.ul,{children:["\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Integration with other web2 social media platforms (Twitter, Google authentication, etc.)."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:"Integration with other identity and asset related web2 data sources (open banking, identity and AML checks)."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.li,{children:"The team's long-term plan is to become the platform for providing properties of private web2 data for consumption by web3 applications."}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.h2,{id:"additional-information-heavy_plus_sign",children:["Additional Information ","\u2795"]}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"How did you hear about the Grants Program?"})," Web3 Foundation Website"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},28453:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{R:()=>o,x:()=>s});var i=n(96540);const a={},r=i.createContext(a);function o(e){const t=i.useContext(r);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function s(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:o(e.components),i.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
